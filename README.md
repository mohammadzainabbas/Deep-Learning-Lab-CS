### 1. Introduction

The main goal of this course is to present the basics of `Deep Learning` and some of its _applications_. It is based on several widely known courses that has proven effective such as the [Deep Learning Book](https://www.deeplearningbook.org/) and [Dive into Deep Learning](https://d2l.ai/index.html) website.

We will take interest in various domains of Deep Learning such as _Computer Vision_, _Generative Models_, and _Natural Language Processing_, To put into application what you will learn, various practical sessions will be performed along with a small project on a specific task.

### 2. About the course

At the end of this course you will be able to:

- [x] Perform the training of _Deep Learning models_ as well as evaluate their performance
- [x] Discuss and provide solutions to various tasks in _Computer Vision_, _Generative Models_, _Natural Language Processing_ etc

<a id="main-topics" />

#### 2.1. Main Topics

- [x] Introduction + Machine Learning Basics + Deep Neural Networks: fundamentals

### 3. Labs

The main aim of this repository is to keep track of the work we have done in __Massive Graph Management and Analytics (MGMA)__ labs. During this course, we will focus on some basic graph algorithms and see how we can utilise these algorithms to efficiently analyse our data. Since, there exist many similarities between graph theory and network science, you will see us using network science related packages as well.

#

<a id="lab-1" />

#### 3.1. Lab 01 - NetworkX

[NetworkX](https://networkx.org/) is a Python package for the creation, manipulation, and study of the structure, dynamics, and functions of complex networks.

Please checkout lab's details [here](https://github.com/mohammadzainabbas/MGMA-Lab/tree/main/src/lab1) 

#

<a id="setup" />

### 4. Setup

If you want to follow along with the lab exercises, make sure to clone and `cd` to the relevant lab's directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mohammadzainabbas/MGMA-Lab.git
cd MGMA-Lab/src/<lab-of-your-choice>
```

> For e.g: if you want to practice lab # 1, then you should do `cd MGMA-Lab/src/lab1`.

<a id="create-new-env" />

#### 4.1. Create new enviornment

Before starting, you may have to create new enviornment for the lab. Kindly, checkout the [documentation](https://github.com/mohammadzainabbas/MGMA-Lab/blob/main/docs/SETUP_ENV.md) for creating an new environment.

#

Once, you have activated your new enviornment, we may have to install all the dependencies for a given lab (kindly check if `requirements.txt` file exists for a given lab before running the below command):

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### 4.2. Setup `pre-commit` hooks

In order to setup `pre-commit` hooks, please refer to the [documentation](https://github.com/mohammadzainabbas/MGMA-Lab/blob/main/docs/SETUP_PRE-COMMIT_HOOKS.md).
